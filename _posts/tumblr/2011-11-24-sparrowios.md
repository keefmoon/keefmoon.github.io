I LOVE Sparrow mail App on OSX, and the idea of it on the iPhone is very exciting. Iâ€™ve never liked the default Mail App, and wondered why no-one was making mail clients on iOS. I assumed the Apple would claim that it duplicated built-in functionality, maybe they changed the policy recently, since the GMail App is now out.
