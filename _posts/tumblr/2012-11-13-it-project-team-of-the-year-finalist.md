The Hotels.com iOS team has been named as a finalist for the BCS IT Industry Awards 2012, in the category IT Project Team of the Year.
I wrote about being shortlisted, but we have made it to the final, and representatives will be attending a black tie awards ceremony tomorrow (Wed 14th Nov).
Fingers crossed!
