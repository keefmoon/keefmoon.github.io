<p class="p1">Friday was my last day at <a href="http://www.hotels.com/"><span class="s1">Hotels.com</span></a>, I&rsquo;m leaving for a new contract at the BBC.</p>
<p class="p1">I have been working there for nearly a year and have enjoyed my time immensely. I have made some really good friends and greatly improved my understanding of software development practices, and I put that down to the great working environmentÂ and the skill and patience of my colleagues.</p>
<p class="p1">My team bought me the most amazing leaving present ever, THE BIGGEST MUG IN THE WORLD, which they all signed. Thanks all :)</p>
