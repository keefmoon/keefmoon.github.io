title: Sponsor me to run the London marathon (almost) barefoot
---

<p>I will be running in this year&rsquo;s London Marathon, and to be honest, I&rsquo;ve left the fundraising quite late.</p>
<p>I am running to raise money for the NSPCC, which is a fantastic charity that does great work.</p>
<p>This is my first marathon, although I&rsquo;ve run 2 half marathon&rsquo;s previously. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough of a challenge, I&rsquo;ll be running it barefoot&hellip;. sort of.</p>
<p>Instead of running in cushioned trainers, I will be running the marathon in minimalist footwear that does little more than stop my feet getting cut on sharp stones.</p>

<p>You can find out more about barefoot and minimalist running on Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_running">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_running</a></p>
<p>I am looking to reach a sponsorship goal of £2,000 so please sponsor me anything you can spare.</p>
<p>To sponsor me, please visit <a href="http://keef.me/barefoot-sponsor">http://keef.me/barefoot-sponsor</a> or you can text KEEF55 and an amount to 70070. For example, sending the following text:</p>
<p>KEEF55 £10</p>
<p>to 70070 would sponsor me for £10 and be much appreciated.</p>
