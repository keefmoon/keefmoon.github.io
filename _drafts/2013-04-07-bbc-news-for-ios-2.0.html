title: BBC News for iOS 2.0
---

<p>For just over the last 4 months, I&rsquo;ve been leading a small team that has been working to update the BBC News App for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>This new version went live this week and is a significant update. The App has been re-built from the ground up, allowing for a refreshed UI, and addresses a number of bugs and stability issues with the previous version.</p>

<p>The update also improved the accessibility of the App, ensuring VoiceOver users can navigate the App with ease.</p>
<p>Response to version 2.0 has been overwhelmingly positive:</p>

<p><span>Today’s update of BBC News for iOS is a major one. Layout has been revamped, and it’s clearly faster.</span></p>

<p>And the iPad App was picked an Editor&rsquo;s Choice by the App Store:</p>

<p><span>We have noticed a few niggling issues, that will hope to address with an update soon, but in all a very successful launch, and an App we are proud of.</span></p>
