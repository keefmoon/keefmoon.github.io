But jumping to an up to date topic, I feel like I closed the book on the other things I should already have mentioned.</p><p>So, to free me up to blog about anything I feel like, here is a rapid fire round up of blog-worthy things, since my last post:</p><ul><li>I spent a long time working with a great team on a version 3.0 of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-news/id377382255?mt=8">BBC News app on iOS</a>, it was going to be GREAT... and then it all fell apart. We lost support from management, and the team imploded. Maybe someday I'll post the follow story of what happened. I've no idea how much of my code ended up in the app that was released, but I'm still proud of the work we did.</li></ul><ul><li>I worked on the app for <a href="http://supercard.io">Supercard by Travelex</a>, cool product, and it was a nice app, had some cool little flourishes. I lead a small team, and we built it in about 3 months.</li></ul><ul><li>Next, I joined a team at <a href="http://www.aimia.com">Aimia</a>, the company behind the <a href="http://www.nectar.com">Nectar loyalty scheme</a>. The company was undergoing an "agile transformation", and our team worked with a fantastic agile coach, who helped us setup a great Kanban system that made us really efficient.</li></ul><ul><li>In the summer of 2015, I worked on a complete redesign of the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nct-babychange/id427067798?mt=8">Babychange app</a> I built for the <a href="https://www.nct.org.uk">NCT</a> (did I mention that it is <a href="../nct-babychange-award-winning">award winning</a>? ;)). I decided to undertake the ground up rewrite in the newly available <a href="https://swift.org">Swift programming language</a>. Building an app end to end in Swift was a fantastic learning experience, and was very useful for what came next...</li></ul><ul><li>In October 2015 I joined a newly formed team to build a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/travelsupermarket-cheap-holidays/id1076336923?mt=8">flagship app</a> for <a href="https://www.travelsupermarket.com">Travel Supermarket</a>. We had a great team, comprising some of the best developers I've worked with, and we decided to jump into Swift development with both feet. We built a very modular architecture, using Swift access control to enforce good separation of concerns. Turns out other people thought this was a good idea too, and called it <a href="https://christiantietze.de/posts/2017/01/oop-framework-oriented-programming">Framework Orientated Programming</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Since July 2016, I've been working with <a href="https://www.just-eat.co.uk">Just Eat</a> as part of the payment team. It's a great place to work.</li></ul><ul><li>In November 2016, I spoke at the <a href="http://mbltdev.ru/en">MBLT.dev</a> conference in Moscow, with a talk called "Thinking in Swift". It seemed to be well received. The video of the <a href="https://youtu.be/MNrvQ5tt8dU?list=PLufI-p7bsMuTsKqt5O51J5OsAm-sH9osH">talk is available on YouTube</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/keefmoon/ThinkingInSwift">code and slides are available on GitHub</a>.</li></ul><p>So, with all that off my chest, now I can write about what ever comes up.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/bbcnews">bbc-news</a></li><li><a href="/tags/travelex">travelex</a></li><li><a href="/tags/aimia">aimia</a></li><li><a href="/tags/nctbabychange">nct-babychange</a></li><li><a href="/tags/tsm">tsm</a></li><li><a href="/tags/justeat">just-eat</a></li><li><a href="/tags/speaking">speaking</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
